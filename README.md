##How to Start 

###
1.Run the following command in both sub-folders separately to install the dependencies:

npm install

2.To run the application, you will need to have two separate terminal windows or tabs open: one for the frontend folder and the other for the backend folder. You will want to start the application in backend folder, then the frontend folder. You can start the application with the following command:

npm run start

3.You will get a notification in the terminal window when starting the server in the frontend folder, stating that the port 3000 is in use and asking if you would like to use another port like below:

Would you like to run the app on another port instead? â€º (Y/n)

Type y in the terminal prompt to use a different port.

*Note that the start command runs nodemon for the backend server and react-scripts for the frontend server. Any code changes you make in these folders will trigger the application to re-render automatically.
